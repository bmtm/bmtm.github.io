In a stunning upset, Jack Qiao has been crowned “King of BMTM” by the collective will of its members. Thunderous applause echoed through SFU’s hallways this Wednesday evening as the unprecedented event took place. 

Never before has a sitting president of a Toastmasters International chapter been ousted from his position during his tenor, but due to the extreme unpopularity of Steve Kim’s club management and the clamouring of its members, Toastmasters International decided to back the popular challenger Jack Qiao. In subsequent investigation it was revealed that Steve only won the election due to extensive vote rigging. He has since been banned from the organization and is awaiting trial for criminal charges.
